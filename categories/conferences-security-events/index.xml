      <description>Last month, I helped organize a security conference in Toronto called BsidesTO. I&amp;rsquo;ve attended and volunteered at my fair share of conferences, but this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had an integral role in throwing and event of this scale.
One day, two floors, 14 speakers, and over 150 attendees. It was a blast. An exhausting blast.
Bsides. is a brand for security conferences around the world.
