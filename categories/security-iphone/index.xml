Letterpress is an iOS game that came out a few weeks ago and immediately became popular enough to take down Apple&amp;rsquo;s GameCenter. It&amp;rsquo;s a cross between Scrabble and Go. The game is played on a board made out of 25 letters and players take turns building words in order to capture the letters they use.
I was hopelessly addicted to Letterpress until I figured out how to win consistently.</description>
