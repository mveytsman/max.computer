Today was presentation day at Hacker School. I have a 10 minute talk about "building a better doorbot" which was secretly a talk about exploiting stack buffer overflows.  People seemed to enjoy it.

The slides are available [here](/assets/files/doorbot_overflow.pdf), and the source code is [here](https://github.com/mveytsman/doorbot_overflow).
