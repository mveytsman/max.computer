In 2015, we transitioned our consultancy into a product company and I switched my title from the ambiguous "partner" to the equally ambiguous but more startupy "founder." 

[Appcanary](https://appcanary.com) tracks vulnerabilities in open source software, and notifies you if one of your dependencies needs to be upgraded. We were part of [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) in the summer of 2015, and I've been writing code and talking to users ever since.
