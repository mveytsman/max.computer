After the Ruby [security apocalypse](http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2013/01/10/rails-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-explained/), we had to figure out if any of our projects at [State Machinery](/projects/stateio) were vulnerable and patch them. We realized that manually checking Gemfiles for vulnerable versions was tedious and prone to error, so we built Gemcanary to monitor your Gemfiles and email you if any vulnerabilities came out.

Gemcanary was designed as a free service to drive traffic to our consultancy, but after a few years we realized that focusing on commercializing the product was the right move and wound down the consultancy to focus on our current canary-themed venture, [Appcanary](/projects/appcanary).
